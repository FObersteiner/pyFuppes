Info on adjustments of the independent variable:
Measurement time-stamp is synchronized to CARIBIC master PC time.
Info on measurement uncertainty:
Uncertainty is estimated to be at least 1 ppb OR 2.0% for the UV photometer and 2.5% combined for the chemiluminescence detector (use whatever value is larger).
